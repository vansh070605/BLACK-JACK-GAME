Here's a suggested README for your Blackjack game project:


# Blackjack Game

This project is a simple, interactive Blackjack game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to provide an engaging single-player experience, where players can play against the computer (dealer) following traditional Blackjack rules.

## Features

- **Classic Blackjack Rules**: The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack, including hit, stand, and bust mechanics.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can choose to hit or stand, and the game automatically calculates results based on the player's and dealer's hands.
- **Dynamic UI**: The user interface updates in real-time, showing card animations and game results.

## Project Purpose

This project was created to practice and improve front-end development skills, especially JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and CSS styling for game UI elements.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click "Start Game" to begin.
3. Choose "Hit" to draw another card, or "Stand" to let the dealer play.
4. Try to reach as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealerâ€™s score!

## Future Improvements

- Adding advanced animations for card dealing.
- Implementing a scoring system and options for multiple rounds.
- Adding sound effects and background music.
